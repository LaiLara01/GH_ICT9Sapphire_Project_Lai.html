                <h1 style= "color: darkred;">History</b></h2>
                <hr>
                <p> It started in the early 1900s when there was an increase in fires in residential and commercial buildings. People started to realize that they needed to learn how to avoid fires in their homes and places of business. So, we started an organization dedicated to teaching people how to prevent fires. This organization today helps to educate thousands of people every year.
